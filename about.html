				<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			</div>

			<h2>Are Dietitians the same as Nutritionists?</h2>
			<h3 class="poppins-regular">Unlike a nutritionist, a dietitian must complete accredited education, pass a national exam, maintain a license, and meet ongoing education requirements. Their services are regulated and often covered by insurance, reflecting their higher level of training and professional standards.</h3>

			<h2>Do you take insurance? Which are you in network with?</h2>
			<h3 class="poppins-regular">We take insurance! We currently accept Blue Cross Blue Shield, Cigna, Aetna, and EmblemHealth. If you'd like to work with us and do not see your insurance listed, please reach out as we offer cash pay options.</h3>

			<h2>Can I use my Flexible Spending Account (FSA) or Health Savings Account (HSA) for payment?</h2>
			<h3 class="poppins-regular">Yes! Clients can typically pay for our services with flex spending (FSA) cards or with Health Savings Account (HAS) cards!</h3>

			<h2>Can I cancel or reschedule my appointment?</h2>
			<h3 class="poppins-regular">Your appointment is reserved for you. A credit card on file is required to secure it. Please notify us by phone or email if you need to cancel or reschedule—advance notice allows us to offer the time to another client. Cancellations made with less than 24 hours notice or no-shows will result in a $100 fee for initial assessments or the full fee for follow-ups.</h3>
